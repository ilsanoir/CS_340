# CS_340

I generally try to create long term maintainable code by avoiding hardcoding and using variables whereever I can. For the CRUD module that I developed, I could have implemented a lot more fail-safes that checked for more 
errors and attempted to check trhough more queries to ensure validity.

The biggest element to approaching a problem like a computer scientist is planning. Rather than simply tossing myself into a problem, I try to make a plan first and ensure that I have general ideas and knowledge that can be 
used in the context of whatever problem I'm trying to solve, before actually tackling an issue.

Computer scientists solve problems. From developing entirely new technologies, to making a functional website, a computer scientists job is to be able to understand a client's vision and make that vision a reality. In this case, my work helped (somewhat) make Grazioso Salvare's work more streamlined and easier to keep track of their animals.
